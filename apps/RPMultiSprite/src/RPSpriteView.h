/*
 * RPSpriteView - draw packed 4 bpp sprites from microSD into RPGfx's
 * framebuffer, fast enough to animate from the card every frame.
 *
 * Originally by Simon (filmote). Optimised for the RPGame board; every
 * change is described where it is made, and the story as a whole is in
 * the header comment of RPSpriteView.cpp.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * FILE FORMAT (unchanged, as written by the PNG -> RPGfx converter)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   byte 0      width  w (pixels, 1..255)
 *   byte 1      height h (pixels, 1..255)
 *   then        h rows of ceil(w/2) bytes, 2 px per byte, even x in the
 *               LOW nibble - exactly RPGfx's framebuffer packing, which is
 *               what lets opaque sprites be copied into it byte for byte.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TWO WAYS TO DRAW
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *   1. Load once, draw many (the fast one - use this for animation):
 *
 *        SpriteFile fire[16];
 *        spriteLoad(fire[i], "FIRE/FIRE_00.BIN");        // in setup()
 *        ...
 *        SpriteDirty d;  spriteDirtyReset(d);
 *        spriteDraw(fire[frame], 0, 64, -1, &d);          // in loop()
 *        spriteFlushDirty(d);                             // only what changed
 *
 *      spriteLoad() opens the file ONCE, finds where it physically lives
 *      on the card, and remembers that (20 bytes). spriteDraw() then never
 *      touches the file system again: one CMD18 streams the blocks straight
 *      in, with the next block arriving by DMA while the previous one is
 *      being copied.
 *
 *   2. drawSpriteFile(path, x, y) - Simon's original one-shot call, kept
 *      for convenience. It does a spriteLoad() + spriteDraw() each time, so
 *      it pays for the directory walk on every call.
 *
 * Call SD.begin() once in setup() before either. Never call it per access.

 * whole extra block every frame. The fire frames are 2 + 4096 bytes: the
 * last 2 pixel bytes would otherwise cost a 512-byte block each frame
 * (~0.17 ms at 24 MHz, ~4% of the frame). 8 covers that with room to

/* Screen area whose framebuffer bytes actually CHANGED during a draw.

 * Opaque draws diff every row against what is already in the framebuffer,
 * so an animation frame reports only the pixels that differ from the
 * previous one. Flushing just those to the panel is the biggest saving
 * there is, because the LCD transfer is as large a slice of the frame as
 * the SD read. Transparent draws report their whole on-screen rows.
 *
 * Why bands rather than one rectangle: a single bounding box of the fire's
 * changes is ~3750 px, but only ~1560 px really change - the flames are
 * ragged, not rectangular. Keeping one box per 16-row screen band follows
 * the outline more closely; spriteFlushDirty() then merges neighbouring
 * bands whenever one bigger rectangle is cheaper than two (each rectangle
 * costs a window command and a pipeline restart).
 *
 * Measured on the device (12 bpp, fire demo), pixels sent / fps:
 *   one bounding box        3750 px  221 fps
 *   16-row bands            3055 px  231 fps
