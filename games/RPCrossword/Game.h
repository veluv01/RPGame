// A puzzle in play: entering letters, what locks, the score and the clock.
//
// With checking on (the default), a word locks the moment it is complete
// and right - gold tiles, points, a streak that multiplies them - and a
// complete wrong word costs a little and ends the streak. One word of every
// puzzle, always the same one, is its jackpot: it pays three times over.
// With checking off there are no locks: the grid is judged only when every
// cell is right.
// No graphics in here: the host tests build this file as it is.
