// The play screen: the grid, the clue under it, the score beside it, the
// letter board that slides up to type on, and the show when a word locks.
//
// The whole grid is in view (8 px cells up to 13 x 13, 7 px for 14 and 15)
// until the camera whips in to the close-up, twice the size, round the
// cursor: tiles with edges, the words' numbers in their corners, letters in
// a large face. It does while the letter board is up, and while B is held.
// The screens (Screens.cpp) own the buttons; this owns the cursor and what
// it does.
