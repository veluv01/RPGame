// Fat: read-only FAT16/FAT32 on top of sd::read (RPGameSD; clean-room, MIT,
// from HypeRunner: see NOTICE).
//
// Written from the Microsoft FAT specification (BPB fields, FAT type from
// the cluster count, 8.3 directory entries, end-of-chain marks) and the MBR
// partition table layout. It only turns a file name into LBA runs: after
// that a file is read as raw card blocks through its run list, so there is
// no FAT write code, no cache and no file object. Every call borrows the
// caller's 512 B buffer (4-byte aligned) and clobbers it; the volume state
// is 24 B. What a game does not call is left out of its image by the linker.
//
// Names are 8.3 short names as the directory stores them: 11 characters,
// capitals, the name and the extension padded with spaces ("WORDS   DIC"),
// and '?' stands for any character. Long-name entries, volume labels and
// hidden entries are skipped; a file never matches a folder name, nor a
// folder a file name.
