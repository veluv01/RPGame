/* Put a hot loop in SRAM. Flash on this part runs at 3 wait states at
 * 48 MHz (RM 20.3.1); SRAM runs at zero.
 *
 * The section name looks odd on purpose. The core's link script puts
 * *(.gnu.linkonce.r.*) first in .data, which has a RAM VMA and a flash
 * LMA, so startup copies it for us - and FIRST matters: .sdata and .sbss
 * come after, inside the 4 KB window the global pointer reaches, where a
 * small variable costs one instruction to load instead of two. Code
 * placed after them (1.2 used .srodata.*, which lands there) pushes the
 * sketch's variables out of that window, and each access to one of them
 * grows: most of the 2.3 KB CHChess's first 1.3 build grew by was that.
 * A ".data.*" name would sit in the right place too but
 * makes the assembler warn about section attributes. The linkonce part is
 * harmless: it only merges sections of the SAME name, and every function
 * here has its own.
 *
 * Every function gets a section of its OWN for a second reason: with one
 * shared name the linker sees a single input section and --gc-sections
 * can only keep or drop all of them together, so a sketch that never
 * blits still paid ~500 bytes of SRAM for gfx_blit. */
