"""Where things are in the repository, for the shared tools.

The games and apps are the CHGame library's examples, so that the Arduino
IDE lists them under File > Examples > CHGame:

    platform/board/arduino/CHGame/libraries/CHGame/examples/Games/<Name>
    platform/board/arduino/CHGame/libraries/CHGame/examples/Apps/<Name>

That is a long way down, so the shared tools take a sketch by its name as
well as by its folder (`chgame --sketch CHFour build`, `python
tools/readme_gif.py CHFour`), and `chgame` run from inside a game's folder
finds the game by itself (`here()`).
